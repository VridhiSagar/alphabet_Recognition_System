# alphabet_Recognition_System
Sign language is widely used by individuals with hearing impairment to communicate with each other conveniently using hand gestures. However, non-sign-language speakers find it very difficult to communicate with those with speech or hearing impairment since it interpreters are not readily available at all times. Many countries have their own sign language, such as American Sign Language (ASL) which is mainly used in the United States and the English-speaking part of Canada. The proposed system helps non-sign-language speakers in recognizing gestures used in American Sign Language. 

In this project, we are using SURF (Speeded up Robust Feature) on different algorithms like SVM and Naive Bayes for ASL gesture recognition and comparing the efficiency of  these models.
